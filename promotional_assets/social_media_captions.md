## 4. The Viral "Educational" Hook (For Realtor / Authority Building)
*Best for: Carousel Slides (Hook -> Tips)*

**Headline:** 🛑 STOP DESIGNING BORING WEBSITES.

**Caption:**
"Pixel perfection is killing your vibe. 💀
When creating the identity for AERU, I threw out the standard 12-column grid and safe typography to build something that actually stops the scroll.

Here are 3 rules I broke to make it work:

1️⃣ **Type IS Image:** Don't just treat text as content. Treat it as a graphic element. Scale it up until it feels uncomfortable. Then scale it up again.

2️⃣ **Controlled Chaos:** Symmetry is safe. Asymmetry creates tension. Tension creates interest. We used a 7/5 split grid to keep the eye moving.

3️⃣ **Motion with Purpose:** Kinetic typography isn't just decoration—it dictates the pace of the user's journey.

## 5. The "Asset Drop" (Save-able Content)
*Best for: Palette Card, Typography Slide*

**Headline:** 🎨 STEAL THIS VIBE.

**Caption:**
"Stop using the same boring pastels. 🍭
If you want to build a brand that cuts through the noise, you need contrast.

Here is the exact specific sauce behind AERU:

🔥 **The Palette:**
*   **Signal Orange:** #FF4D00 (Use for CTA & Alerts)
*   **Void Black:** #101010 (The Anchor)
*   **Canvas Cream:** #FFF8E7 (Softer than white, easier on the eyes)

🔤 **The Type Stack:**
*   **Header:** Arial Black (Tracking -5%). Brutal. Loud.
*   **Body:** Courier New (Bold). Techy. Raw.

Save this for your next project. 💾
